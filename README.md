# Touch Screen Motorcyles
You are the perfect motorcyclist. You are a computer. You can calculate
exactly what fraction of your traction you can apply to turning and
accelerating. You always travel at top speed, and never bail. You are awesome.

You drive in a parking lot. It sounds stupid but it's really kind of neat.

## Install
You need [PyGame](http://pygame.org) and that's it!

If you're a masochist and you want to run it on Android:

1. ...
2. ...
3. TODO: Instructions other than "figure it out yourself"

## How to Play
Tap/Click on the map to set your target. Your perfect racing skills will
propel you directly through that point as fast as possible. This is analagous
to "You go where you look." If you ride a bike, you know what I mean.

Sometimes, you have to slow down because that turn is just too damn tight. This
makes you overshoot and turn late. You have a circle of your path of travel,
and you can move your target around to get the curve you want.

If you don't see a turning circle, you aren't turning.

You can't turn more than 180 degrees at a time because that just doesn't
make sense. Sorry, no donuts.

## Versions
There is an Android version and a PyGame version. Android is clunky, but it
works. The pygame version is fun to hack on. Good for prototyping.
