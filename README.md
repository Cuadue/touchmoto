# Touch Moto
You are the perfect motorcyclist. You are a computer. You can calculate
exactly what fraction of your traction you can apply to turning and
accelerating. You always travel at top speed, and never bail. You are awesome.

You drive in a parking lot. It sounds stupid but it's really kind of neat.

# Versions
There is an Android version and a PyGame version. Android is clunky, but it
works. The pygame version is fun to hack on. Good for prototyping.

# Install
You need [PyGame](http://pygame.org) and that's it!
